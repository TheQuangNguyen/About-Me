I want to create an About Me page to give the user a little bit of fun while geting to know a little about me and my personality. I created a simple guessing game with JS for user to play along with. Hopefully it gives you a little bit of a laugh. I added 2 extra questions that utilize for and while loops under the hood and give the site a more professional portfolio look.

Worked together with Eric Huang
Put all questions into functions to be called at the end. Simplify the code.
